HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, it is a method computers and servers use to request and send information. It
is used in request-response cycle. 

HTTP/1.1:
The first version of HTTP was created in 1997 and it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP 
was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web, however there were some drawbacks. The first drawback was
that the HTTP/1.1 was known to have a slow response time and therefore there was an increase in the latency and page loading
was slow. HTTP/1.x do not efficiently utilize traffic by compressing the request and response headers. Furthermore, the HTTP/1.1 
protocol is known to be ineffective in resource prioritization, hence the underlying TCP connection is poorly utilized.


HTTP/2:
In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.HTTP/2 solves several problems HTTP/1.1 has.In particular, 
HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes 
content during the loading process. To reduce the amount of data, HTTP/2 introduced header compression that uses a binary framing 
layer to create a stream for communication. During the time of interaction, the TCP connection remains open and the binary format 
for request and response headers enhances the overall performance.HTTP/2 also has multiplexing capability which enables multiple network 
requests over a single TCP connection.

In simple words Objects in JavaScript are an unordered collection of key:value pairs. Objects are complex and each object may contain a combination of
primitive data-types as well as certain functions generally termed as methods. The keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and
methods, respectively, in the context of an object. An object can be created with curly brackets {} with an optional list of properties.
There are different ways to create Javascript Objects such as:

Way 1-

const coffeeCup = new Object();
coffeeCup.color = 'Black';
coffeeCup.design = 'Solid';

Way -2

const coffeeCup = {
color: 'Black',
design: 'Solid'
};

Way -3

const coffeeCup = {};
coffeeCup.color = 'Black';
coffeeCup.design = 'Solid';
